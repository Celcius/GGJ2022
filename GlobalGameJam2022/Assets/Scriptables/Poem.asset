  - There was once a girl divided%Her mind was undecided
  - Her balance teetered as of late%A swirling, twisting mental state
  - Black or white - are both not good?%Maybe she's misunderstood?
  - 'Social pressures, culture ties%People''s judgement, masks, and lies '
  - She has her sides; divide by two%Both of which must make it through
  - 'One that''s happy, bright and pink%Who likes to talk and loves to sing '
  - One that's quiet, dark, and grim%Knows when to listen, how to think
  - Both are there, and it's okay%To put both sides up on display
  - To those with hearts in disarray:%Accept yourself; the whole bouquet.
  - The sides which make you come alive%Nurture both and surely thrive
